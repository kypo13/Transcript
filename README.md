In this repository, I do some of my activities related to cyber security. I've been working on CTF challenges and getting root on a VulnHub machine.

In the CTF folder, are screenshots of the 2018 and 2019 picoCTF work, where I got a score of 2260 in 2018 and 8450 in 2019, where I did it myself. Then I did some challenge on VulnHub and included writeup for Kioptrix Level 1. Soon another writeup for PicoCTF and another machine on Vulnhub.

Wrietup Vulnhub:
